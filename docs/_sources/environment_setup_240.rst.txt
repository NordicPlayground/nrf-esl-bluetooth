  * `nRF52840 DK`_
  * `nRF52840 Dongle`_
  * `Nordic Thingy:52`_

Optionally, you can use `WAVESHARE e-Paper Raw Panel Shield`_ and `WAVESHARE 250x122, 2.13inch E-Ink raw display panel`_ as a display device in combination with `nRF52833 DK`_ (refer to the :ref:`peripheral_esl_sample_activating_epd_variants`).

For Access Point from the list of supported models:

  * `nRF5340 DK`_ (Recommended for first evaluation)
  * `Nordic Thingy:53`_

Software requirements
*********************

To meet the software requirements, install the following tools:

  * `nRF Connect for Desktop`_
  * `nRF Command Line Tools`_
  * `GO Language`_
  * `Mcumgr Command-line Tool`_

Then:
   Install `nRF Connect SDK v2.4.0`_

   * Follow `Installing automatically`_ guildelines to perform an automatic installation through the Toolchain Manager in the nRF Connect for Desktop or.
   * Follow `Installing manually`_ guidelines to perform a manual installation.

   .. note::
      For additional information on setting up the device as well as Nordicâ€™s development environment and tools, see the `nRF Connect SDK Getting started guide`_.

#. Clone/Download the entire ESL repository.

   Use git:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrf-esl-bluetooth -b v2.4-branch

   or Download the repository from `esl_archive_v2.4-branch`_ , and then unzip it:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ unzip main.zip

#. To build the samples using VS Code or Command line, follow this guide: `Building and programming an application`_.
