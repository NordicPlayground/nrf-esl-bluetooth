nRF Connect SDK: nrf-esl-bluetooth
----------------------------------

This repository contains Nordic Semiconductor implementation (experimental) of the Electronic Shelf Label application as specified by Bluetooth ESL Service/Profile, leveraging Bluetooth 5.4 PAwR and EAD features.

It provides both Access Point and Tag role.

This is an experimental project that can be used for evaluation and development, but it is not recommended for production. It may be incomplete in functionality or verification and can be expected to change in future releases. The project is made available in its current state, but the design and interfaces can change.
